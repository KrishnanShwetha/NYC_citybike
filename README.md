# NYC_citybike

For this exercise Iâ€™ll be working with two years of the bicycle sharing systems for New York City (Citibike). The dataset contains daily bike trip counts, along with daily measurements on environmental and seasonal information that may affect the bikesharing. More details on snow measurements [here](https://www.weather.gov/gsp/snow)
